## The game of battleships on c++


## The Computer Algorithm
For a classic game of battleships with the following settings :
- 10x10 grid
- 1 boat (2x1)
- 2 submarines (3x1)
- 1 destroyer (4x1)
- 1 carrier (5x1)
  
It will take you around 95/100 guesses on average if you shoot completely randomly.
That's why if we were to invent an algorithm to play the game, we would have to make it significantly better in order to have a chance against humans.
Our algorithm does it in only around 35 moves in this particular game settings and gets the upper hand against a human around 8/10 times!
